shellmenu 0.10 notes

Author:  Michael A. Taylor <mataylortech@gmail.com>

This is a work-in-progress.  The purpose of this project is to provide a simplified tool for quickly creating and maintaining menu-driven shell scripts, while addressing some of the tedious formatting challenges of whiptail and zenity.  It is essentially a wrapper for whiptail and zenity with the ability to also create menus in a terminal when neither are available.

Pre-requisites:

  Linux terminal, xterm, putty, etc.
  bash
  tput
  grep, egrep
  awk
  sed
  bc
  more


At least one of the following is recommended, but not strictly required.
  whiptail
  zenity
