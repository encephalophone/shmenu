1.0 Renamed all test-xxx files to demo-xxx.
2.0 Fixed bug in demo-drawline, title of color select was "--show-keys".  The switch "--show-keys" is only valid on radiolist and checkbox dialogs.  Replaced switch with "Color Selection".
3.0 demo-entry: added tPause after echoing entry text to the terminal, otherwise the screen would go right back to the top of the loop and show the dialog again.
4.0 Fixed typos in ui-functions/Dlg().
5.0 In ui-functions, added space between ) and { on line 386, beginning of gDlg function. This caused the function name to not show in documentation output.

1.0 ui-functions: Added "2>/dev/null" to end of each line that calls zenity in order to supress the message "Gtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged", which in this case is a useless warning.
2.0 added args to demo script for specifying which type of interface to use: -g|--gui, -t|--tui, -c|--cui|--cli, writes change to shmenu.conf
3.0 Moved shmenu.err log to local directory instead of /var/log, because we will not always be running as super user.
